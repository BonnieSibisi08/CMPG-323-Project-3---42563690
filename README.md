# CMPG-323-Project-3-Design & Architecture Patterns  
# Overview
In today's world, where millions of applications are widely used, my ability to read and understand code is often more crucial than just writing it. For this project, I will be tasked with enhancing and improving an existing web application that manages CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for project and client data. I am expected to have a strong grasp of architectural patterns and focus on implementing coding principles and design patterns that align with the project's requirements.
